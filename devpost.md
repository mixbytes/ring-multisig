## Elevator Pitch
dApp to anonymously vote on critical decisions (euthanasia, death senstence, etc.) using BN256 ellicptic curve

## Inspiration
We want to solve problem of critical decision making and unability to gurantee privacy of those collective decisions.

## What it does
dApp allows judge to create a new proposal and nominate juries who in turn can cast votes using their respective private keys.
Prosopal creator specifies criteria for decision to be enforced (N of M signatures).
Juries cast their votes that are counted by smart contract preserving full privacy.
